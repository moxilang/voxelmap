ImageMesh: Low-Poly 3D Reconstruction
=====================================

**Author:** Andrew R. Garcia

Introduction
------------

**ImageMesh** is a method in VoxelMap for turning **2D images into 3D meshes**.  
It works by slicing an image into sectors and building **Convex Hulls** in each sector, producing a lightweight `.obj` model.

- **Voxel-based (ImageMap)** ‚Üí dense voxel cloud  
- **Mesh-based (ImageMesh)** ‚Üí compact polygonal mesh  

ImageMesh is best when you want **fast, low-poly 3D models** suitable for Blender, PyVista, or game engines.

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from voxelmap import Model
   from voxelmap.mesh import ImageMesh, MeshView   # üëà import from mesh

   model = Model(file="docs/img/land.png")

   # create a low-poly mesh with sector partitioning
   ImageMesh(model.array, out_file="land.obj", L_sectors=15)

   # preview interactively (requires voxelmap[mesh])
   MeshView("land.obj", color="white", alpha=0.8)

‚û° Produces a lightweight terrain mesh.

When to Use ImageMesh
---------------------

- ‚úÖ You want **compact models** (small `.obj` files).  
- ‚úÖ You don‚Äôt need voxel-level detail.  
- ‚úÖ You plan to edit meshes in Blender, Maya, etc.  
- ‚ùå If you need detailed volumetric rendering ‚Üí use **ImageMap** instead.

Appendix: Technical Notes
-------------------------

ImageMesh partitions the input image into **sectors**.  
Each sector is mapped to 3D points by treating pixel intensity as **depth**, then enclosed by a **Convex Hull**.  

- The algorithm uses `scipy.spatial.ConvexHull` (QuickHull).  
- Increasing sectors captures more local detail (see figure below).  
- Mesh complexity is proportional to the number of sectors, not the number of pixels.

.. figure:: ../img/imagemesh/sectors.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: Effect of sectors

   Left: 1 sector. Middle: 4 sectors. Right: 16 sectors.

**Complexity (summary):**
- Time ‚âà :math:`\mathcal{O}(w h n \log n)`  
- Space ‚âà :math:`\mathcal{O}(n \sqrt{s}/3)`  

Where :math:`w, h` are image size, :math:`n` points per sector, and :math:`s` sectors.

Conclusion
----------

ImageMesh gives you a **fast, memory-efficient** way to turn 2D images into usable 3D assets.  
For advanced users, the original complexity analysis and whitepaper are preserved here for reproducibility.
